# Scalebound
This resource is so that large networks can manage 
numerous mini servers.

## What is what?
 * **Master** is the stand-alone application
 * **Slave** is the plugin that goes into the
  proxy (bungee / velocity) and minecraft server (Bukkit / Spigot / Paper)
 * **Shared** is resources used by both the slave and master

## Features
### Server Profiles
A server profile is pretty much how you want the server
to look and feel with plugins, configs and worlds.

You can then add ways to scale these servers in proposition 
to player count.

### Graphs and monitoring
We have a few in build tooling to track 
tps, avg ping, ram usage, cpu usage and player count
